Instructions: 
1. “usage: %s <trackfile> <heightmapfile>”   e.g.: ./assign2 track.txt OhioPyle-256.jpg


Extra stuff: 
1. Use z,x,c to switch between point, line, fill polygon modes for the track (notice it only changes the track, not the walls or ground 
2. Cross-railed colored in gradient and enabled smooth shading 
3. bool enableScreenshot - control if take screenshots
4. bool debugEnabled - control if debug mode turns on! Try it, with it turned on the program takes longer to initialize.
5. Use ‘b’ to turns on “birds-eye perspective”, press ‘r’ to resume the ride!!:)
6. int carSpeed - controls how fast the ride goes 
7. void drawXYZ - draws xyz axis to assist in debugging
